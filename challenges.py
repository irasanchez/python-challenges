# This program reads two numbers and prints their sum:
# get input and convert to integer
a = int(input())
b = int(input())
c = int(input())
print(a + b + c)

# Can you change it so it can read and sum three numbers?

# Write a program that reads the length of the base and the height of a right-angled triangle and prints the area.
# Every number is given on a separate line.
# a = 1/2bh

# Read the numbers b and h like this:
b2 = int(input())
h = int(input())
print((h * b2) / 2)

# Print the result with print()

# Write a program that greets the user by printing the word "Hello", a comma, the name of the user
# and an exclamation mark after it. See the examples below.
# Warning. Your program's output should strictly match the desired one, character by character.
# There shouldn't be any space between the name and the exclamation mark. You can use + operator to concatenate
# two strings. See the lesson for details.

# Read a string:
# a2 = input()
# Print a string:
# print(a2)
